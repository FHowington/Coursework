SAMPLE #4

For questions asking "What's wrong?" Just write a part of a sentence 
or a few words to describe the problem. In some cases the 
answer may be "Nothing" if the code segment is perfectly legal.

For questions asking "What is the output?" just print out what you 
think will appear on the screen as the output of the print statements



1) What's wrong with this program ?

	int[] x = null;
	x = new String[5];
	for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
		System.out.println(x[i]);

	Won't compile: You cannot assign a ref to a String array into a ref to int array 

2) What's wrong with this program ?

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(multiply(x,5));
	}
	public static int multiply(int num1, int y) { return (x * y); }

	Won't compile: the body of multiply refers to x which is a variable back in main

3) What's wrong with this program ?

	int[] x = null;
	x = new int[10];
	for (int i = 0; i < x.length; x = null);


	Our increment clause destroys the array so we get a null ptr exception second time into the body


4) What's the output of this program ?

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int[] arr = new int[10];
		fillArray(arr);
		System.out.println(arr[t]);
	}
	public static void fillArray(int[] arr) // ** BUG FIX **  added static
	{
		arr = new int[5];
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
			arr[i] = i * 2;
	}

	Won't compile: no variable named t exists

5) What's incongruitous about how we wrote/used the printHI() method?
  (Hint: it compiles and executes fine)

	public class Q5
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			printHi();
		}

		public static int printHi()
		{
			System.out.println("Hello!");
			return 1;
		}
	}
	
	< answer here >: printHi() returns an int but we never use at the call site


6) What's wrong with this program ? IGNORE - YOU DONT KNOW RANDOMS YET

	Random r = new Random(10);
	int[] arr = new int[10];
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		arr[i] = r.nextInt(101);
	arr[i - 1] = 0;

	Won't compile: The variable i is not in scope after the for loop is finished

7) Without using a compiler, write a method that receieves an int as a param and returns it as a String.

	public String atoi( int i )
	{
		return ""+ i;
	}



8) There are 2 primary things the keyword "new" does in the follow code segment, "int[] arr = new int[10]".
	What are they?

	Creates the array object with 10 ints in 
	Returns the address of (reference to) the array object
