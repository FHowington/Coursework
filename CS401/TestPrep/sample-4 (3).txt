SAMPLE #4

For questions asking "What's wrong?" Just write a part of a sentence 
or a few words to describe the problem. In some cases the 
answer may be "Nothing" if the code segment is perfectly legal.

For questions asking "What is the output?" just print out what you 
think will appear on the screen as the output of the print statements



1) What's wrong with this program ?

	int[] x = null;
	x = new String[5];
	for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
		System.out.println(x[i]);

	< answer here >

2) What's wrong with this program ?

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(multiply(x,5));
	}
	public static int multiply(int num1, int y) { return (x * y); }

	< answer here >

3) What's wrong with this program ?

	int[] x = null;
	x = new int[10];
	for (int i = 0; i < x.length; x = null);

4) What's the output of this program ?

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int[] arr = new int[10];
		fillArray(arr);
		System.out.println(arr[t]);
	}
	static void fillArray(int[] arr) 	{
		arr = new int[5];
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
			arr[i] = i * 2;
	}

	< answer here >

5) What's incongruitous about how we wrote/used the printHI() method?
  (Hint: it compiles and executes fine)

	public class Q5
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			printHi();
		}

		static int printHi()
		{
			System.out.println("Hello!");
			return 1;
		}
	}
	
	< answer here >

6) What's wrong with this program ? IGNORE - YOU DONT KNOW RANDOMS YET

	Random r = new Random(10);
	int[] arr = new int[10];
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		arr[i] = r.nextInt(101);
	arr[i - 1] = 0;

	< answer here >


7) Without using a compiler, write a method that receieves an int as a param and returns it as a String.

	< answer here >

8) There are 2 primary things the keyword "new" does in the follow code segment, "int[] arr = new int[10]".
	What are they?
